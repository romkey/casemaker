Hmmm....interesting.
The terminology is somewhat in flux nowadays.
Historical terms were: knockouts and bosses
Knockouts are now called cutouts about half the time
Bosses is still technically correct, but the more descriptive terms are often used now: standoffs or mounting posts

I guess it might be most useful to the target audience to avoid the knockouts term and go with cutouts because it is less confusing.  Knockouts harkens back to when everything was metal and the holes were cut with a web left and the installer would knock the slug out on the fly.  Still happens, but not so much with plastic.

As for the bosses.....dealerâ€™s choice as to what you use.
